Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", 
which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. 
Python is an object-oriented programming language that supports OOP concepts 
such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. 
Hereâ€™s an overview of these concepts along with examples to illustrate each one.

1. Classes and Objects

    Class: A blueprint for creating objects. 
    It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects can use.
    Object: An instance of a class. 

2. Inheritance

    Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. 
    The class that is inherited from is called the parent class or superclass, and 
    the class that inherits is called the child class or subclass.
